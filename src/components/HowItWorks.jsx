      <p>Life coaching is a process of goals set by you. We all know each step has roadblocks. We discuss roadblocks and what options you have when they occur. Life coaching is a method to practice small goals towards that final goal. </p>

      <p>Life coaching is not counseling, that's for a licensed professional. If you are having mental health issues or immediate crisis consult a licensed therapist or call 911.</p>
